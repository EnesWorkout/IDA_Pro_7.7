# IDA_Pro_7.7


This project provides information about the usage and features of IDA Pro 7.7, a disassembler and debugger tool. IDA Pro is a powerful disassembler and debugger that can run on various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS. In this project, we will cover the basics of using IDA Pro, its features, and some tips.


## Usage

After downloading the project files, you can open them with IDA Pro. IDA Pro supports various file types and has extensive disassembly capabilities.

1. **Open File**: Launch IDA Pro and select the file you want to open.
2. **Analysis**: IDA Pro will automatically analyze the file and provide a disassembly view.
3. **Exploration and Inspection**: You can inspect the code in the disassembly view, define functions, and trace program flow.
4. **Debug Mode**: Use debug mode when needed to step through the program and debug it.

## Files

This project contains sample files analyzed with IDA Pro 7.7. The list of files is as follows:

- `example1.exe`: Disassembly view of a sample Windows application.
- `example2.dylib`: Disassembly view of a sample macOS dynamic link library.
